# Community Building Introduction

- A shared interest or environment can be really easy way to start a community but its not always enough to build a successful community
- It's important to have a shared struggle to build a successful community
- Spare special attention to the question "What people want from the community?" and "What can be done to bring those things to them?"
- Engage your membbers create future leaders and get help during your time as a leader.
- Whenever problem arises there'll be a huge temptation of feeling that you have to do everything yourself to solve this problem, you have to organise that event, you have to give a talk.
- Every problem is an opportunity to make space for someone else in your community & help someone elese rise up.
- Think about the future in the structure you choose.
