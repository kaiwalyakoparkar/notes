# Inclusive Community

- A place where people can be on their best days as well as worst days and yet accepted
- Make sure communities are not intentionally harming others
- when building a community, focus on designing for margins. Which means think about every possible worst case.
- Be specific, Be outlined, Be accessible
- Be aware of difference between intent and impact
- Focus on impact
- Adding information for impact is meaningful
- Enforce and reinforce the code of conduct
- Prioritize the safety of the marginalized over the comfort of the privileged
- Acknowledge when you can't accomodate
