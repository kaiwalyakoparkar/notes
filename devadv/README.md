# Developer Advocacy Notes ðŸ¥‘

Again, these are not notes, these are some resources (blogs, podcasts, yt videos) you can access to learn more on different aspects and topics. These are mostly the collection of resource I refer and look back to.

I might add more pages to it as I grow in experience and try out different techniques but this is it for now :D
