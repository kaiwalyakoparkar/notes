# Custom Resource Definition

- We can create custom resources like pod, deployment.
- First we need to add CRD and then add the custom resource.
- We need custom controller to monitor and change based on this CRD

# Operator Framework

- We don't have to manage, apply CRD and custom resources seperates.
- We can package them using operator framework
- All operators are available at `operatorhub.io`
